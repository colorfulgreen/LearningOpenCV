    /* NOTE: use Gaussian blurring to downsample an image

    Downsampling is equivalent to convolving with a series of delta functions, which introduces 
    high frequencies into the result signal. When an image contains high-frequency content (fast 
    variations), downsampling can produce visually weird or annoying aliasing or moir√© artifacts.

    To avoid this, we want to first run a high-pass(?) filter over the signal to band-limit its 
    frequencies so that they are all below the sampling frequency. TODO

    Sampling theorem: Band-limited function can be recovered completely from a set of its samples 
    if the samples are acquired at a rate exceeding twice the highest frequency content of the 
    function. Sampling must exceed the Nyquist rate.
